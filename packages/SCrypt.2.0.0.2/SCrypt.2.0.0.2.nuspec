    <description>This subset of CryptSharp contains only its SCrypt and any-HMAC PBKDF2 functionality.
If you need these algorithms for purposes unrelated to passwords, this package may be sufficient for you. If you are dealing with passwords, use the "CryptSharpOfficial" package.</description>
    <releaseNotes>2.0.0 (May 8, 2013):
  Documentation! The meaning of methods, no longer a mystery...

  Utilities:  
  Made the Pbkdf2 class easier to use.
  Optimized the SCrypt code. It is now 50% faster.
  
  Miscellaneous:
  I now code-sign the CryptSharp DLL so you can confirm it is unaltered.

1.2.0 (January 23, 2011):
  The SCrypt KDF is now supported as CryptSharp.Utility.SCrypt.
  Added djb's Salsa20, required by SCrypt.
  
If you have any questions, comments, or run into any problems, don't hesitate to send me an e-mail at jfb@zer7.com or visit the CryptSharp website at http://www.zer7.com/software/cryptsharp

Thanks and enjoy the library!
